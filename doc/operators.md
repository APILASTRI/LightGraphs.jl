*LightGraphs.jl* implements the following graph operators. In general,
functions with two graph arguments will require them to be of the same type
(either both `Graph` or both `DiGraph`).

### complement
```
complement(g::LightGraphs.Graph)
complement(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
Produces the Base.Markdown.Link(Any["graph complement"],"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph") of a graph.

### reverse
```
reverse(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
(`DiGraph` only) Produces a graph where all edges are reversed from the original.

### reverse!
```
reverse!(g::LightGraphs.DiGraph)
```
(`DiGraph` only) In-place reverse (modifies the original graph).

### blkdiag
```
blkdiag{T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
```
Produces a graph with $|V(g)| + |V(h)|$ vertices and $|E(g)| + |E(h)|$ edges.

Put simply, the vertices and edges from graph `h` are appended to graph `g`.

### intersect
```
intersect{T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
```
Produces a graph with edges that are only in both graph `g` and graph `h`.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### difference
```
difference{T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
```
Produces a graph with edges in graph `g` that are not in graph `h`.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### symmetric_difference
```
symmetric_difference{T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
```
Produces a graph with edges from graph `g` that do not exist in graph `h`, and vice versa.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### union
```
union{T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, h::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
```
Merges graphs `g` and `h` by taking the set union of all vertices and edges.

### induced_subgraph
```
induced_subgraph{T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}}(g::T<:Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, iter)
```
Filters graph `g` to include only the vertices present in the iterable argument `vs`. Returns the subgraph of `g` induced by `vs`.
