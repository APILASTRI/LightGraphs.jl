*LightGraphs.jl* implements the following graph operators. In general,
functions with two graph arguments will require them to be of the same type
(either both `Graph` or both `DiGraph`).

### complement
```
```
```rst
::
           complement(s)

Returns the set-complement of :obj:`IntSet` ``s``.
```

Produces the [graph complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph) of a graph.

### reverse
```
```
```rst
::
           reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )

Return a copy of ``v`` reversed from start to stop.
```

(`DiGraph` only) Produces a graph where all edges are reversed from the original.

### reverse!
```
```
```rst
::
           reverse!(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]]) -> v

In-place version of :func:`reverse`.
```

(`DiGraph` only) In-place reverse (modifies the original graph).

### blkdiag
```
```
```rst
::
           blkdiag(A...)

Concatenate matrices block-diagonally. Currently only implemented for sparse matrices.
```

Produces a graph with $|V(g)| + |V(h)|$ vertices and $|E(g)| + |E(h)|$ edges.

Put simply, the vertices and edges from graph `h` are appended to graph `g`.

### intersect
```
```
```rst
::
           intersect(s1,s2...)
           ∩(s1,s2)

Construct the intersection of two or more sets. Maintains order and multiplicity of the first argument for arrays and ranges.
```

Produces a graph with edges that are only in both graph `g` and graph `h`.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### difference
```
```
Produces a graph with edges in graph `g` that are not in graph `h`.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### symmetric_difference
```
```
Produces a graph with edges from graph `g` that do not exist in graph `h`, and vice versa.

Note that this function may produce a graph with 0-degree vertices.

### union
```
```
```rst
::
           union(s1,s2...)
           ∪(s1,s2)

Construct the union of two or more sets. Maintains order with arrays.
```

Merges graphs `g` and `h` by taking the set union of all vertices and edges.

### induced_subgraph
```
```
Filters graph `g` to include only the vertices present in the iterable argument `vs`. Returns the subgraph of `g` induced by `vs`.
