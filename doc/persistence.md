## Writing a Graph
Graphs may be written to I/O streams and files using the `write` function:

### write
```
write(io::IO, g::Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
write(g::Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph})
write(g::Union{LightGraphs.Graph,LightGraphs.DiGraph}, fn::AbstractString)
```
```rst
::
           write(stream, x)

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given stream.
```

Writes a graph `g` in a proprietary format to the IO stream designated by `io`.

Return tuples containing the number of vertices and number of edges written.

Writes a graph to a file `fn`, with default `GZip` compression.

Return tuples containing the number of vertices and number of edges written.



## Reading a Graph From a File
Graphs stored using the `write` functions above may be loaded using `readgraph`:

### readgraph
```
readgraph(fn::AbstractString)
```
Returns a graph loaded from file `fn`.

### readgraphml
```
readgraphml(filename::AbstractString)
```
Returns a graph from file `fn` stored in [GraphML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) format.

### readgml
```
readgml(filename::AbstractString)
```
Returns a graph from file `fn` stored in [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) format.



## Examples
```julia
julia> write(STDOUT, g)
julia> write(g, "mygraph.jgz")
julia> g = readgraph("mygraph.jgz")
julia> g = readgraphml("mygraph.xml")
julia> g = readgml("mygraph.gml")
```
